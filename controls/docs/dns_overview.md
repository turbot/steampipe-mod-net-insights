## Overview

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed database that stores IP addresses and other data and allows queries by name. The types of information elements associated with domain names, are categorized and organized with a list of DNS record types (or resource records), e.g., `A`, `AAAA`, `NS`, `SOA`, `MX` etc. These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other functions as well.

This benchmark contains best practice checks for several types of DNS records.
