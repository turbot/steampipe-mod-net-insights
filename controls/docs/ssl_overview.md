## Overview

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an encryption-based internet security protocol for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers. This protocol helps in the transmission of data securely in a standards-based manner. It helps to establish secure communication between the client and the server by allowing the use of digital signatures, mutual authentication and encryption.

This security benchmark performs various standard security checks on certificates and SSL server configuration for a given domain.
