## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- What are the DNS records for my domain?
- Are my DNS records configured according to best practices?
- Are my DNS records secure?
- Are my DNS records compliant with security best practices?
- Are my DNS records compliant with regulatory standards?

## Getting started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [Net plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install net
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default Net credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net#multi-account-connections) or [customize Net credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/net#configuring-net-credentials).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mod-net-insights
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.
